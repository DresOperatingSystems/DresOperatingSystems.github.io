                    <p>Hello, we are DresOS, an open source organization dedicated to enhancing security and development for Android devices, Linux machines, apps, and bots. Our mission is to provide privacy-focused, secure and innovative tools that empower users in a digital world.</p>
                    <p>To explore our work, check out the tabs: Learn about our ecosystem in DresEcoVerse, get updates on our upcoming Linux distro, discover our secure communication app in DresSecureComms, and browse our GitHub projects for more open source contributions.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>DresEcoVerse</h2>
                    <p>The DresEcoVerse is our central Telegram group where we release updates related to our organization, where you can post bug reports, feedback, and more. Join us at <a href="https://t.me/+gqKa5SMoAls4NWY0">The DresEcoVerse</a> (with over 288 members as of early 2026) to stay connected. It features dedicated channels for various topics, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>UPDATES</strong>: Latest news and announcements from DresOS.</li>
                        <li><strong>APPS</strong>: Our curated FOSS app list.</li>
                        <li><strong>BOTS</strong>: Info on our Telegram bots, including why some may be offline (e.g., shutdowns for maintenance).</li>
                        <li><strong>GITHUB PROJECTS</strong>: Links to our github projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>DresOS: The Defensive Security Distro</strong>: Devlogs and progress updates on our Linux distro.</li>
                        <li><strong>DRES RADIO</strong>: what we listen to whilst we work.</li>
                        <li><strong>FEEDBACK</strong>: Share your thoughts on our projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>BUG REPORTS</strong>: Report any issues you find in our projects.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the DresEcoVerse, we're posting regular devlogs for our Linux distro so you can follow the development journey. You can also find other apps we've released under DresOS there.</p>
                    <h3>FOSS Apps Section</h3>
                    <p>The FOSS Apps section in the EcoVerse is a curated collection of the best privacy-focused, security-enhancing and quality-of-life apps for Android. We’re especially proud of this one as it shines a light on many underrated open source developers. For a couple of them we went the extra mile by writing detailed descriptions to help users get the most out of each app.</p>
                    <h3>DresTor</h3>
                    <p>DresTor is a refreshed and maintained fork of an older Tor client from The Guardian Project that had unfortunately fallen out of active development. We updated it and gave it a proper home so it could continue to serve the FOSSverse.</p>
                    <h3>DresGeoSpoofing</h3>
                    <p>DresGeoSpoofing is a fork and improvement of an excellent location spoofing app originally created by Matias and his team. This was a learning exercise for us as we want to begin developing our own original apps and it was our way of saying thank you to Matias for actually inspiring us to work on apps. We left all credits to Matias and his team in the app so others can discover their outstanding open source work.</p>
